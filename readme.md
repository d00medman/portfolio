notes:

Turn on venv w/ `source venv/bin/activate` and turn off `deactivate`

Note that when you're running Venv, you need to pip install pretty much every single
time.

Venv should be put in the gitignore

gemfile equivalent in python is created by running this command in venv `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
